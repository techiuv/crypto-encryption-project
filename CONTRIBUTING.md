# Contributing to Crypto Encryption Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Crypto Encryption Project! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding new features. To ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow the guidelines outlined below.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the [repository](https://github.com/your-username/crypto-encryption-project) to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project under your own GitHub user.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Clone the repository to your local machine to start making changes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/techiuv/crypto-encryption-project.git
cd crypto-encryption-project
```
#### 3. Create a New Branch

Before you start working, create a new branch for your feature or fix. Branch names should be descriptive of the work being done:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-or-fix-name
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

If there are any dependencies required, ensure they are installed. Currently, this project requires:
- **GCC** for compiling C programs.
- **Bash** for running the shell script.

## Making Changes

### Code Style

Please follow these coding style guidelines when contributing:

- **C Code:**
  Follow common C programming conventions. Keep your code clean and well-commented.
- **Shell Scripts:**
  Use consistent indentation and follow shell scripting best practices.

### Adding Features or Fixes

- Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality.
- If adding a new feature, consider writing corresponding tests if applicable.
- Update documentation (`e.g., README.md`) if your changes affect usage or add new features.

### Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of the feature or fix"
```

### Push Your Changes

Push your changes to your forked repository:
```bash
git push origin feature-or-fix-name

## Submit a Pull Request

Once your changes are pushed to your fork, open a Pull Request (PR) against the main branch of the original repository:

- Go to the original repository on GitHub.
- Click on the "New pull request" button.
- Select the branch you just pushed from your forked repository.
- Provide a clear title and description for your PR.
- Submit the pull request

## What Happens Next?

After you submit your pull request, it will be reviewed by the maintainers. They may ask for changes or clarification before merging. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository.
